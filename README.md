# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project, I will be cleaning the data tables and preparing them for analysis. Once they are ready for use, I will perform some statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data. I will also include a QA process to ensure the results of my analysis are accurate.

## Process
Step 1 - I loaded each csv file into pgAdmin and examined the data to determine what cleaning was needed and how the table might relate to each other.
Step 2 - I checked each table for duplicate rows first. Then, I scanned through the tables to look for other potential issues. I referenced the questions about the data to determine what information I would need to be able to pull and how it needed to be cleaned to allow for that.
Step 3 - I worked through each question provided.
Step 4 - To come up with my own questions, I tried to look at what other information the tables present that the given questions did not touch on and what might be interesting about those pieces of information.

## Results
Looking at this data, I found the vast majority of site traffic does not result in any sales. The biggest market for this website is the United States and the most popular category of poduct is apparel.

## Challenges 
It was quite difficult to determine exactly how these tables should relate to each other. It seemed like revenues and quanities of units conflicted across tables. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time with this data, I would dig into more detail about shared characteristics of visits that result in sales to determine if there were ways the business could increase their sales.
